1. Create a Table in Hive
Use the CREATE TABLE command to define the table structure. Example:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
2. Load Data from Local Path into the Table
Assume your data file is named data.txt and is located in /path/to/local/data.txt. The command to load the data is:

sql
Copy code
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/local/data.txt' INTO TABLE my_table;
Key Points:
LOCAL: Specifies that the data file is on the local file system.
Path: The full path to the local file.
INTO vs. OVERWRITE:
INTO TABLE: Appends data to the table.
OVERWRITE: Replaces the existing data in the table.
3. Verify the Data
Run a query to confirm that the data was loaded:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM my_table;
Example Data File Format (data.txt)
Ensure your local file is formatted correctly based on the table's definition. For the example above:

txt
Copy code
1,John,30
2,Jane,25
3,Doe,28

Here are additional operations you can perform after creating and loading data into a Hive table:

1. Querying Data
Run various queries to analyze the data.

Simple Select Query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM my_table;
Filter Data:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE age > 25;
Aggregate Functions:
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count, AVG(age) AS average_age FROM my_table;
Group By:
sql
Copy code
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS count FROM my_table GROUP BY age;
2. Alter Table Operations
Add a New Column:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMNS (gender STRING);
Rename a Column:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE my_table CHANGE name full_name STRING;
Rename the Table:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE my_table RENAME TO my_new_table;
3. Insert Data into the Table
Insert New Data:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO TABLE my_table VALUES (4, 'Alice', 23);
Insert from Another Table:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO TABLE my_table
SELECT * FROM another_table WHERE age < 30;
4. Export Data
Export to Local File:
sql
Copy code
INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/path/to/export'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
SELECT * FROM my_table;
Export to HDFS:
sql
Copy code
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/hdfs/path/to/export'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
SELECT * FROM my_table;
5. Create and Use Partitions
Partitioning improves query performance by dividing data into subsets.

Create a Partitioned Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE my_partitioned_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
PARTITIONED BY (country STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
Load Data into a Partition:
sql
Copy code
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/path/to/local/data.txt' 
INTO TABLE my_partitioned_table 
PARTITION (country='USA');
6. Create and Use Buckets
Bucketing improves data management and query optimization.

Create a Bucketed Table:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE my_bucketed_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
Enable Bucketing in Hive:
sql
Copy code
SET hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
7. Joins and Advanced Queries
Inner Join:
sql
Copy code
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.salary
FROM my_table a
JOIN employee_table b
ON a.id = b.id;
Left Join:
sql
Copy code
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.salary
FROM my_table a
LEFT JOIN employee_table b
ON a.id = b.id;
Window Functions:
sql
Copy code
SELECT id, name, age,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY age ORDER BY id) AS rank
FROM my_table;
8. Drop or Truncate Data
Drop Table:
sql
Copy code
DROP TABLE my_table;
Truncate Table (removes all rows but keeps structure):
sql
Copy code
TRUNCATE TABLE my_table;
